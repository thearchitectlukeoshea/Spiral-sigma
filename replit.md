# Overview

Flame Relay is a Flask-based backend service designed for file upload and processing. The application provides a REST API for handling file uploads with built-in security measures including file size limits and secure filename handling. The service appears to be designed as a lightweight file processing backend with health monitoring capabilities.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Backend Framework
- **Flask**: Chosen as the web framework for its simplicity and lightweight nature, making it ideal for a focused file processing service
- **RESTful API Design**: Implements standard HTTP methods and JSON responses for clean API interactions

## File Handling Architecture
- **Secure File Upload**: Uses Werkzeug's secure_filename utility to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **File Size Limits**: Implements 16MB maximum file size limit to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Upload Directory Management**: Automatically creates and manages an 'uploads' directory for file storage

## Security Measures
- **Request Size Limiting**: Built-in protection against oversized requests through MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH configuration
- **Filename Sanitization**: Prevents malicious filenames that could compromise the filesystem
- **Environment-based Secrets**: Uses environment variables for sensitive configuration like session secrets

## Error Handling and Monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: Implements Python's logging module for proper error tracking and debugging
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Provides service monitoring capabilities through dedicated health endpoint
- **Graceful Error Responses**: Returns proper HTTP status codes and JSON error messages

## Configuration Management
- **Environment-based Config**: Uses environment variables with fallback defaults for flexible deployment
- **Modular Settings**: Separates configuration concerns (file limits, directories, secrets) for maintainability

# External Dependencies

## Core Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Werkzeug**: Provides security utilities for file handling and HTTP utilities

## Standard Library Usage
- **os**: Environment variable access and filesystem operations
- **zipfile**: File compression/extraction capabilities (imported but implementation incomplete)
- **logging**: Application logging and error tracking

## Runtime Environment
- **Python Runtime**: Requires Python environment with Flask ecosystem
- **File System Access**: Needs write permissions for upload directory creation and file storage

## Deployment Considerations
- **Environment Variables**: Expects SESSION_SECRET environment variable for production security
- **Storage Requirements**: Requires persistent storage for uploaded files in the uploads directory
